This hack is ONLY TO UNLOCK DVD MULTI REGION, FOR ME, BLU-RAY IS STILL LOCKED.

I have bestowed my Panasonic DMP-BD83 Blu-Ray player the ability to play any DVD, regardless its region (Multi Region DVD Hack). By using a Samsung Galaxy S5, IRPlus App and some infrared codes, I was able to get my Blu-Ray player to read a Region 2 DVD (player's original region is 4). 

The codes that I used to unlock my Panasonic DMP-BD83 Blu-Ray Player also works on the Panasonic DMR-EX83 and the Panasonic DMP-BD84. So, there is a good chance that the hack/procedure may work on other Panasonic Blu-Ray players. Just follow the steps and check it out yourself!
